  * Understand the principles of how Elasticsearch works.
  * Set up PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch using Docker.
  * Create an Elixir project with a page displaying a table of articles, including the author's name, publish/unpublish status, tags, publication date, creation date, update date, and a label (where we'll store the article URL).
  * Add buttons and modals for creating, updating, and deleting articles.
  * Fetch articles and implement search by author and text using Elasticsearch.
  * Ensure that create/update/delete requests affect both the database and Elasticsearch.
  * Cover the project with tests.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `sudo docker compose up -d` to install and setup dependencies
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
